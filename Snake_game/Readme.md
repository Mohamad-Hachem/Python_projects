# Welcome to my snake game 
### This project is built to simulate an OOP(Object oriented programing) project with some inheritence 
<i>the game contains 4 main parts</i>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>main.py</li>
<li>score.py</li>
<li>snake.py</li>
<li>food.py</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p> The 2 classes food and score inherit from the built in python module (turtle)</p>
<p> the snake class uses the turtle module inside it as well (not inherited)</p>
<p> all main actions are written in main <p>
<hr>
